    # We use an unpacked manually managed sub chart / dependency chart - therefore we do not point to the chart repo
    # To update the dependency chart:
    # - uncomment this line and then run `helm dependency update charts/spark-operator`
    # - unpack the .tgz file overriding the sub-chart, delete the .tgz file, and run `helm dependency update charts/spark-operator` again
